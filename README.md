# PySparkLab

The purpose of this practical is to learn the capabilities of Spark in an incremental fashion. The developed application will be a Recommender System, i.e. a system which provides useful suggestions for users. The student will implement different kinds of recommendation algorithms in a distributed fashion while covering Spark's main capabilities: MapReduce, batch programming, real-time data-processing functions, SQL-like handling of structured data, graph algorithms, and machine learning.
